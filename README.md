# Memory Game Project

This is a project created through Udacity's frontend web developer program. Feel free to clone this project from here or you can get the original starter code from here https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game

The game is a classic matching game. Flip one card over and try and match it with another card. The goal of the game is to match all cards as quickly as possible with the fewest moves.

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
